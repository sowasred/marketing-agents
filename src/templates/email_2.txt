Subject: Should I close your file?

Hey [NAME],

Haven’t heard back, totally understand if now’s not the right time.

Creators like you have already started using ReplyFan, generating monthly revenue without lifting a finger.

Should I close the loop on this? Or would you like me to show you how it works?

It's zero setup cost on your side and 100% your brand.

Appreciate your time either way.
