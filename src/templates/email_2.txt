Subject: Following up - ReplyFan for [NAME]

Hi [NAME],

{{Write a brief, friendly acknowledgment that you reached out before. Keep it warm and non-pushy, acknowledging they're probably busy.}}

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about ReplyFan. Since I last reached out, we've helped several [NICHE] creators significantly improve their audience engagement rates.

{{Share a relevant insight or observation about their recent content or comment section. Show you're still paying attention to their channel.}}

Here's what ReplyFan does in a nutshell:
- Automatically generates personalized comment responses that match your voice
- Helps you engage with more of your audience without spending hours in the comments
- Learns from your existing responses to maintain authenticity

Many creators in your space are seeing 3-5x more meaningful conversations with their audience after implementing this.

Would love to show you a quick demo if you have 10 minutes this week. No commitment required - just want to see if it could help.

Check our website to see the details: www.replyfan.com
Book a quick call if you have any questions: https://calendly.com/replyfanapp/30min

Best,
ReplyFan

P.S. If you're not interested, just let me know and I won't bother you again!
